    ----------
    checkpoint : Path or str
        Model identifier from the hf.co model hub.
    asset_file : AssetFileName
        Type of asset file to download.
    subfolder : str, optional
        Folder inside the hf.co model repo.
    token : str, optional
        When loading a private hf.co model, set `use_auth_token`

        token that can be obtained by running `huggingface-cli login`
    cache_dir: Path or str, optional
        Path to model cache directory. Defaults to content of PYANNOTE_CACHE
        environment variable, or "~/.cache/torch/pyannote" when unset.
